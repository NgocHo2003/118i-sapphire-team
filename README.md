# SafeHaven – A Human-Centered AI for Emergency Housing Support

SafeHaven is a generative AI web app created to help real people navigate real struggles—specifically, those seeking Emergency Interim Housing (EIH) services in San José, California. Inspired by conversations around housing equity and support gaps, our team designed SafeHaven to be more than just functional—it’s meant to be empathetic, accessible, and socially responsible.

This project was developed as part of San José State University’s AI for Social Good initiative.

## Key Features

SafeHaven includes three core tools designed to support users:
- AI Housing Intake Assistant: This feature uses GPT-based AI to walk users through a short intake process. It asks about urgency, location, and housing needs, then suggests personalized next steps. It's like having a virtual guide through the EIH process
- Reddit Sentiment Analyzer: This tool pulls real-time public sentiment from Reddit and analyzes what people are saying about homelessness, housing, and local support systems. It helps admins and case managers stay in touch with public concerns.
- Resource Recommendation Map: After completing intake or browsing the app, users can explore a map that shows nearby shelters and services. It updates based on their current needs and location, helping them take immediate action.

## My Personal Contributions

- Contributed to building Streamlit components that power the app’s interface, such as form-based user inputs and chatbot output areas.
- Integrated OpenAI’s API into the chatbot to structure API calls and process user queries into usable data.
- Used GitHub for version control, created and reviewed pull requests, and resolved merge conflicts during collaborative coding.
- Used ChatGPT extensively to write and refine Python code, resolve bugs, and guide feature implementation in Visual Studio Code
- Wrote descriptive content, project summaries, and in-app guidance to clearly communicate functionality to users and stakeholders
- Supported demo preparation and presented the project at the AI for Social Good showcase to highlight ethical and practical value

## 🎓 A Learning Moment

More than just an AI build, SafeHaven taught me how to merge technical problem-solving with human empathy. It challenged me to think not only about *what* we’re building—but *who* we’re building it for.

This isn’t just an app. It’s a small step toward making support systems more navigable for those who need them most.
